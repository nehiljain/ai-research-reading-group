# ai-research-reading-group


**Welcome AI Research Readers (AIRR)**

This is the Github repository for the AI Research readers, focusing on LLM based Agents. We aim to foster a collaborative and closely-knit learning environment through weekly discussions on cutting-edge research on agents.

_This is the first time for most of us doing research paper reading group, so please be patient and open to beginners mistakes we will make._


## Purpose

The goal of our reading group is to:

- Take our understanding of AI Agents from 0 to 100.
- Keep abreast of the latest research developments.
- Become a place to learn together and have accountability.
## How It Works

This is an async-first reading group. Here's our approach to ensure everyone gets the most out of our discussions:
- **Read the Paper:** Start by reading the paper thoroughly. If you're unsure how to approach it, here's a [useful guide on how to read a research paper](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-i-read-research-paper.html).
- **Discussion Preparation:**
    - Post any questions or points for discussion on the GitHub Discussions tab for that paper at least 2 days before the scheduled call.
    - If you're presenting, prepare a document (e.g., PPT, review doc, highlights PDF) to summarize your views on the paper.
    - Review all posted questions before the call, and be ready to integrate them into the discussion.
- **During the Call:** Collaboratively, we'll write a summary document that encapsulates the discussion, key insights, and differing viewpoints.
- **Sharing:** Feel free to share the insights gained from our discussion outside the group. Promoting shared learning is one of our core missions.

**Weekly Discussions:**

- **Paper Selection and Reading:**
    - We'll discuss a new paper each week. You can find them in the `papers` section with the schedule below.
    - We recommend reading the paper by 2 days before our Zoom meeting.
- **Discussions on Github:**
    - We leverage Github Discussions for asynchronous conversations. Find the dedicated thread for the current week's paper in the Discussions section. Feel free to post comments, questions, and insights throughout the week.
    - This helps us come prepared for the Zoom meeting, focusing on deeper discussions and clarifying doubts.
- **Zoom Meetings:**
    - We hold weekly Zoom meetings on Fri/Sat at [Meeting Time] (details also in `logistics.md`). We'll delve into the paper, discuss key points raised in the Github Discussions, and explore further implications.

**Repo Structure:**

- This repository is organized to keep discussions focused:\
    - `notes`: Each week's paper has a dedicated folder here. These folders may contain:
        - `summary.md`: A collaborative document summarizing key takeaways from the paper (everyone can contribute). [Example](https://github.com/dsgiitr/reading-group/blob/master/Jun20/Discussion4/Summary.md)
        - `code`: Any code or experimentation notebooks created by readers.


A collection of concise write-ups on each paper, with something noteworthy is also maintained here.
